# Quick Chat Reply
Quickly reply to chat message using personally selected key-binds!
( No video because my laptop a potato ) 

QUICK NOTICE: This is literally just me taking the [quick-reply plugin](https://github.com/relative/quick-reply) and fixing it.
I am not sure if this is allowed in any way because I have 0 clue how to contact the original guy
## Quick Install
1. Open Command Terminal
2. Run `cd powercord/src/Powercord/plugins && git clone https://github.com/notKnei/quickChatReply`
3. Restart Powercord and Enjoy!
